## Spark Tutorials
A load of Apache Spark Tutorials in Java 8 utilizing Scala and Spark libraries.

### Requirements
Upon pushing this repository, I have made several assumptions:

* You already have IntelliJ IDEA installed. If not, visit https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ and follow installation instructions.
* You have prior knowledge of Java 8 (Streams and Lambdas)

### Execute
* Import the project into IntelliJ and execute whatever tutorial interests you. For simplicity, tutorials are separated into packages.
